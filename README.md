## Projects Portfolio

### Project 1: Cybercrime Trends Analysis

Explored phishing and cybercrime data across Western Europe using Python and visualizations (with Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly and Matplotlib).

#### Key Visualizations

##### 1. Cybersecurity Measures and Attacks by Country (2024)

### Project 2: Neural Style Transfer with Reinforcement Learning

Built a style transfer model enhanced with reinforcement learning to dynamically balance content and artistic style during image transformation.

#####  Example Output
Here is an output generated by the model using Starry Night as the style image:

### Project 3: NLP Pipeline for Text Intelligence

Developed a full pipeline for Natural Language Processing that includes:
- Named Entity Recognition (BiLSTM-based)
- Sentiment Analysis (VADER & Scikit-learn)
- Topic Classification (RoBERTa transformer)

The project compares rule-based and ML approaches, showing strengths and weaknesses in handling real-world text, sarcasm, and topic ambiguity.
